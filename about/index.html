            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, my name is Kamil Mroz and I was born in Chicago on August 27, 2002.
                There isn't realy any fun history behind my name, I just have it. I live in Garfield Ridge by the way.

            <h2>Childhood</h2>
            <p>
                I went to Mark Twain Elementary school and one of my favorite stories from my early days was "Green Eggs and Ham"
                I did have a few friends so I wasn't lonely, lol. I usually played soccer with them or cards. I remember once in kindergarten, I threw a pencil and the teacher yelled at me.
                I ended up being on "red" for the rest of the day.

            <h2>High School</h2>
            <p>
                In high school life is way differentan in elementary school. I guess I feel that the classes are more demanding, but also the teachers do have a sense of humor.
                I am on the Whitney Young tennis team, so I am part of my squad. We havven't won anything recently, but we're getting there.

            <h2>Future Plans</h2>
            <p>
                I'm not sure yet which college I will go to, although I have considered studying abroad. I definitely do want to do something with psychology and social studies.
