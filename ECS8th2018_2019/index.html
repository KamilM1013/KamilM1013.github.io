        Hello. This is my page for all my ECS work for this school year.
        <br>
        I have learned so much this year, but one of the best things is learning how to code. It has really been a game changer for me.
        <br>
        Please be on top of things in this class or you will be lost! Ask the people around for help, you'll be surprised by how much they can help.
